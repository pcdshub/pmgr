## Parameter Manager

Package used in LCLS to manage motor parameters. Currently in use to manage configurations for IMS motors in the LCLS1 hard x-ray hutches.

The conda build does not support the GUI, which requires a specific build of pyqt that adds some types that can be emitted that are cruicial for the table to work.
